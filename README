If you make changes to the KeePassRPC plugin you will need to increment the version number in a few places in order to ensure that your new version is installed correctly by the updated version of KeeFox.

To increment the version number in all locations look in:

AssemblyInfo.cs: AssemblyFileVersion attribute
KeePassRPCExt.cs: PluginVersion property
install.rdf
json.js: clientVersion - near the top of the file
